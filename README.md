# RAG-based-PDF-QnA-System

## Introduction

An end-to-end **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that enables semantic question answering over user-uploaded PDF documents. Built using **FastAPI**, **LangChain**, **ChromaDB** and **FAISS**, with support for **multi-user sessions**, **query caching**, and **containerized deployment**.

## üîç Key Features

- **Multi-PDF Support**: Upload and analyze one or more PDF documents.
- **Multi-User Sessions**: Isolated sessions using unique session IDs to prevent data leakage between users.
- **Asynchronous API**: FastAPI with `async` endpoints enables concurrent query handling.
- **Query Caching**: Reduce latency for repeated queries with in-memory cache.
- **Semantic Search**: Use FAISS to perform vector-based retrieval on document chunks.
- **Fully Containerized**: One-line setup with Docker and `docker-compose`.
